Solidus Elastic Product
-----------------------

This integration for Solidus ecommerce stores provides a performance way to index products to Elastic Search. To achieve that, products are concurrently serialized & uploaded with background jobs in batches. The _serialize_ and _upload_ operations are split and are performed independent of each other. A table wrapped by the `Elastic::Product::State` model is used to store the state of an indexed product.

The `State` table contains the following fields:

```ruby
{
                             :id => nil,
                     :product_id => nil,
                           :json => nil,
                       :uploaded => false,
    :locked_for_serialization_at => nil,
           :locked_for_upload_at => nil
}
```

where the `json` field is a string representation of a serialized product; the `upload` flag indicates if the product has been synced with Elastic, while the two locked columns ensure the concurrent serialization and upload processes do not overlap each other.


--

The integration focuses primary on the backend synchronization of products with Elastic Search, and as such, does not have any frontend viewes. In the future, such might be added as example only to the spec dummy app.

It does however have a dependency on the official [Elasticsearch Model](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-model) library and exposes its full interface through the `Index` and `State` classes.

 - Use the `Solidus::ElasticProduct::Index` class to perform class operations (define index name, do mappings, perform search or manipulate the index)

 - Use the `Solidus::ElasticProduct::State` class to perform instance level operations with individual indexed products (update, destroy, etc..)


Installation
------------

Add solidus_elastic_product to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_elastic_product'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_elastic_product:install
```

Customize
---------

All of [Elastic Search Model](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-model's) class methods are available through the `Index` class. So, you can directly customize them. Example from an initializer:

```ruby
# initializers/solidus_elastic.rb
Solidus::ElasticProduct::Index.index_name
Solidus::ElasticProduct::Index.document_type
Solidus::ElasticProduct::Index.mapping
```

To customize the export, define `Solidus::Elastic::Config.serializer_class` to respond to `#generate_json` method and define an ActiveRecord refinement method `#each_for_serialization` to preload associations. See the default [Product::Serializer](https://github.com/boomerdigital/solidus_elastic_search/blob/master/app/models/solidus/elastic/product/serializer.rb) as an example.


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_elastic_product/factories'
```
